A basketball game where the shoes are glued to the floor.<br />
You have five players on the court - but nobody can move.<br />
The ball starts with your in-bounder.<br />
Click on other players to pass.<br />
Click on the basket to shoot.<br />
Players closer to the basket are more likely to score.<br />
If a pass or shot is blocked, the other team might score.<br />
The game is played to 7 points.  Good luck!<br>
